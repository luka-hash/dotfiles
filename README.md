# dotfiles

My personal collection of dotfiles.

These are mostly for my own setup, but there are some scripts that are setup-agnostic. 

Also, these are testes on linux system only (so no macos support, as of yet)

## Notes
- `file-server` is a program I created in Go, soo long ago, that I lost original source code of it, so yeah

## TODO
